# Solid Documentation 
Documentation of solid development is messy, I've attempted to organize what I think is most useful below

## App dev
- Recommended: [solid-ui-react Github](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-ui-react#development)
  - Good for authentication in [React](https://solid-ui-react.docs.inrupt.com/?path=/docs/usage--page), beyound that not too great
  - **Note**: their [example app](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-ui-react-demo) has dependency issues, and is deprecated. Here's a [working one](https://github.com/link2pod/NextAppExample)
  - **Note**: their [online storybook](https://solid-ui-react.docs.inrupt.com/) is also kindof broken, and data components aren't documented
- [Inrupt JS Library Usage Examples](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/using-libraries/)
  - Provides good introduction to RDF modelling
  - Strong tools for [reading+writing data](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/tutorial/read-write-data/)
- [Solidproject first-app tutorial](https://solidproject.org/developers/tutorials/first-app) 
  - Parcel issues, would not recommend

## Solid Servers (Optional reading)
Not too important, so just go the recommended
- Recommended: [Github Repo Docs - Getting started](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/tutorials/blob/main/getting-started.md)
  - Great introduction, goes over concepts at good level. (30-45 mins)
- [Solidproject server hosting](https://solidproject.org//self-hosting/css)
  - Useful for seeing all the options and quickstarting 
  - insufficient details for anything useful
- [Github Repo Docs](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer/tree/main/documentation/markdown)
  - More details, but useful tutorials and links to references
